      <li>In all our discussions to date we have implicitly assumed that
        our charges have been located in a vacuum or on the surface of
        conductors.&nbsp; We now need to consider how to take into
        account the presence of non-conducting material in the real
        world.&nbsp; Dielectric material is simply another way of saying
        non-conducting material.</li>

          height="211" align="right" width="436">Imagine a parallel
        plate capacitor in which a dielectric material is placed between
        the plates (at right below).&nbsp; The dielectric is composed of
        atoms/molecules which contain positive and negative
        charges.&nbsp; The applied electric field between the plates, E<sub>0</sub>,
        will cause the positive and negative charges of the constituent
        atoms/molecules to move slightly in opposite directions
        (right).&nbsp; Electric dipole moments will be "induced" in the
        material, as shown.&nbsp; The net effect will be for charge to
        appear on the surface of the dielectric material as shown.&nbsp;
        The dielectric is said to have been polarized, leading to a
        polarization electric field, E<sub>P</sub>. <br>
