      <li>In electrostatic conditions - no electric current flow -
        Gauss's Law applied to conductors (typically metallic objects)
        leads to some important conclusions.</li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote><img alt="exclamation" src="exclamation-icon.gif"
        height="30" width="31"> Note that since a conductor contains
      "free" charges if an electric field exists anywhere in the
      conductor a current will flow.&nbsp; Thus, in electrostatic
      conditions ("static" means all charges are at rest) there can be
      no electric field anywhere in the conductor.<br>

          conductor having a net charge</b></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>Under electrostatic conditions, <b>E</b> = 0 throughout
      the object.&nbsp; Applying Gauss's Law to the closed surface A, we
      conclude that there can be no charge inside A.&nbsp; But the
      conductor has a net charge.&nbsp; The only possibility is that the
      charge resides outside the surface A.&nbsp; If we gradually
      increase the size of A, so that eventually it lies just below the
      surface of the conductor, the charge must still reside outside
      A.&nbsp; Therefore, as a consequence of Gauss's Law, any <b>charge





        placed in a conductor must reside on its surface.</b><br>

      <li><b>Insulated hollow charged conductor (conducting shell)</b></li>
    </ul>
    <blockquote>
      <p>We now hollow out the conductor, changing nothing else.&nbsp;
        Thus, there is no charge inside the hollowed out conductor, so
        that <b>E</b> = 0 inside.&nbsp; This fact leads to the
        necessity for an antenna to pick up radio signals inside a
        car.&nbsp; Radio waves are comprised of electric and magnetic
        fields (electromagnetic waves - much more later), which must be
        received by the radio.&nbsp; But the car is approximately a
        hollow metallic conductor, which means <b>E</b> = 0
        inside.&nbsp; Without an antenna the radio waves cannot be
        received by the radio.&nbsp; The antenna provides a "shielded
        channel" to direct the radio signal into the car.<br>

        <blockquote>
          <p>It can be shown mathematically that if Coulomb's Law is not
            exactly of the inverse square form - 1/r<sup>2</sup> then
            the electric field inside a closed conductor would not be
            exactly zero.&nbsp; All experiments to date have failed to
            measure such an electric field, with an accuracy such that
            we know that the inverse component of r in Coulomb's Law is
            2 with an accuracy of 16 decimal places.<br>
