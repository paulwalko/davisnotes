    <ul>
      <li>We now begin a discussion of wave (physical) optics in which -
        in contrast to geometric optics - we explicitly consider the
        wave nature of light.&nbsp; Remember, in geometric optics light
        traveled in straight lines (light rays).&nbsp; This is a valid
        approximation so long as we do not consider apertures with
        dimensions similar to the wavelength of the light or look too
        closely at the edges of objects.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>So what happens when a wave passes through apertures whose
        size is similar to the wavelength of the wave ?&nbsp; First
        we'll consider the case of double slit interference, in which a
        parallel beam of incident monochromatic (containing a specific
        wavelength) light from the left strikes a screen with two slits,
        S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> , as below.</li>

            immediately opposite S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> .&nbsp;
            The rest of this screen would be in shadow.&nbsp; What is
            actually observed on the right hand screen is an

              <li>The explanation is that each slit acts as a source of
                spherical waves, which "interfere" as they move from
                left to right as shown above.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>In the diagram at the top of the page, light reaching
                P from S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> will travel
                different distances.&nbsp; Assuming that the light from
                the two sources S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> are
                initially in phase, then due to the path difference S<sub>1</sub>P
                - S<sub>2</sub>P , at P the two waves will be out of
                phase.&nbsp; If the path difference is equal to an
                integral number of wavelengths the waves will interfere
                constructively, leading to a bright spot on the
                screen.&nbsp; Mathematically we can write this <b>condition

                                      in two coherent sources, since
                                      this type of radiation is
                                      typically produced in a continuous

                                      The radiation is emitted in
